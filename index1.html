          <p class="p2">
            Most people who have worked a 9-5 have been fed up with its
            repetitive nature at least a few times. This customized piece from
            Brooklyn-based artist Travis W. Simon channels this frustration.
            Commissioned by retailer Mode Operandi, Simon's "F*ck 9-5"
            inscription appears in bold red paint across the dial of a vintage
            Cartier Santos Dumont timepiece. The watch itself, sourced from
            vintage specialist Foundwell, is an 18-carat gold Ref. 78097 that
            dates back to the 1980s and was disassembled for painting before
            being put back together. In fine working order and showing no more
            wear than expected for a timepiece of its age, it's coming up for
            auction via Watches of Knightsbridge on November 13th.
