            <p class="p2">
              Most people who have worked a 9-5 have been fed up with its
              repetitive nature at least a few times. This customized piece from
              Brooklyn-based artist Travis W. Simon channels this frustration.
              Commissioned by retailer Mode Operandi, Simon's "F*ck 9-5"
              inscription appears in bold red paint across the dial of a vintage
              Cartier Santos Dumont timepiece. The watch itself, sourced from
              vintage specialist Foundwell, is an 18-carat gold Ref. 78097 that
              dates back to the 1980s and was disassembled for painting before
              being put back together. In fine working order and showing no more
              wear than expected for a timepiece of its age, it's coming up for
              auction via Watches of Knightsbridge on November 13th.

            In 1926, the creation by Rolex of the first waterproof and dustproof
            wristwatch marked a major step forward. Given the name “Oyster”,
            this watch featured a hermetically sealed case which provided
            optimal protection for the movement. It is one thing to claim a
            watch is waterproof. It is quite another to prove it. In 1927 a
            Rolex Oyster crossed the English Channel, worn by a young English
            swimmer named Mercedes Gleitze. The swim lasted over 10 hours and
            the watch remained in perfect working order at the end of it. In
            1931, Rolex invented and patented the world's first self-winding
            mechanism with a Perpetual rotor. This ingenious system, a true work
            of art, is today at the heart of every modern automatic watch.
