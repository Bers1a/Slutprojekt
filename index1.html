            <p>TRAVIS W. SIMON'S F*CK 9-5 CARTIER WATCH </p><p>Most people who have worked a 9-5 have been fed up with its repetitive nature at least a few times. This customized piece from Brooklyn-based artist Travis W. Simon channels this frustration. Commissioned by retailer Mode Operandi, Simon's "F*ck 9-5" inscription appears in bold red paint across the dial of a vintage Cartier Santos Dumont timepiece. The watch itself, sourced from vintage specialist Foundwell, is an 18-carat gold Ref. 78097 that dates back to the 1980s and was disassembled for painting before being put back together. In fine working order and showing no more wear than expected for a timepiece of its age, it's coming up for auction via Watches of Knightsbridge on November 13th.</p>
